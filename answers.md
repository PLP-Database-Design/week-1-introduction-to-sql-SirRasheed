### 1. **Components of a DBMS**
   A Database Management System (DBMS) consists of several components that work together to store, retrieve, and manage data. These components include:

   - **Database Engine**: Core service that manages data storage, retrieval, and update operations.
   - **Query Processor**: Interprets and executes database queries written in SQL or other query languages.
   - **Transaction Manager**: Ensures the database remains consistent and reliable by managing transactions and maintaining ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties.
   - **Metadata Manager**: Handles the schema and structure of the database, including data types and constraints.
   - **Storage Manager**: Manages how data is stored on physical storage devices.
   - **User Interface**: Interfaces such as command-line tools or graphical user interfaces (GUIs) that allow users to interact with the DBMS.

### 2. **What is a Relational Database?**
   A relational database organizes data into tables (relations) consisting of rows (tuples) and columns (attributes), which makes it easy to identify relationships between different data points using keys.

   **Examples**:
   - MySQL
   - PostgreSQL
   - Microsoft SQL Server
   - Oracle Database

### 3. **Three Classifications of SQL**
   SQL (Structured Query Language) is classified into three main categories:

   - **Data Definition Language (DDL)**: Defines or modifies the database structure. Examples include:
     - `CREATE`: Creates a new table or database.
     - `ALTER`: Modifies existing structures.
     - `DROP`: Deletes tables or databases.
   - **Data Manipulation Language (DML)**: Deals with data operations. Examples include:
     - `INSERT`: Adds new records to a table.
     - `UPDATE`: Modifies existing data.
     - `DELETE`: Removes data from tables.
   - **Data Control Language (DCL)**: Manages access to the database. Examples include:
     - `GRANT`: Gives permissions to users.
     - `REVOKE`: Removes permissions.

### 4. **Difference Between a Primary Key and a Foreign Key**
   - **Primary Key**: A unique identifier for each record in a table. Ensures no duplicate or NULL values.
     - Example: `id` column in a `users` table.
   - **Foreign Key**: A reference to the primary key in another table. It establishes a relationship between two tables.
     - Example: `user_id` in an `orders` table referencing `id` in a `users` table.

### 5. **What is an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)?**
   An Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) is a visual representation of the entities, attributes, and relationships in a database. It helps in designing and understanding the database schema before implementation.

### 6. **Advantages of Relational Databases**
   - **Data Integrity**: Enforces rules like primary and foreign keys to maintain accuracy.
   - **Flexibility**: Allows complex queries using SQL.
   - **Scalability**: Can handle large volumes of data effectively.
   - **Security**: Provides granular access controls.
   - **Redundancy Reduction**: Eliminates duplicate data through normalization.

---

### 7. **Four Types of Data Types Used in Tables**
   - **Integer**: For storing whole numbers. Example: `INT`, `SMALLINT`.
   - **Character/String**: For text data. Example: `VARCHAR`, `CHAR`.
   - **Date/Time**: For date and time values. Example: `DATE`, `DATETIME`.
   - **Floating Point/Decimal**: For decimal numbers. Example: `FLOAT`, `DECIMAL`.

### 8. **Purpose of a Database Management System (DBMS)**
   The purpose of a DBMS is to efficiently manage data, ensuring:
   - **Storage**: Organizes data systematically.
   - **Retrieval**: Provides fast access through query processing.
   - **Consistency**: Maintains data integrity and avoids conflicts.
   - **Security**: Protects data through access controls and encryption.
   - **Scalability**: Manages growing datasets efficiently.
